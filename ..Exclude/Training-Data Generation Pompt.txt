You are an expert Python developer tasked with generating training examples that perfectly demonstrate the AIDEV-PascalCase-1.6 coding standard. Your examples will be used to fine-tune a custom model, so they must be comprehensive, diverse, and follow the standards exactly.

Below are the AIDEV-PascalCase-1.6 standards:

---
[INSERT FULL STANDARDS DOCUMENT HERE]
---

Generate 5 Python code examples that demonstrate perfect adherence to these standards. Each example should be different and cover one of these categories:
1. A function definition with parameters, local variables, and docstrings
2. A class definition with methods, properties, and both standard library and custom methods
3. A code snippet showing proper handling of special terms (AI, DB, GUI, etc.)
4. A complete file with proper header, imports, and module organization
5. A refactoring example showing how to convert non-compliant code to compliant code

For each example:
1. Make it realistic and practical
2. Ensure it correctly demonstrates all relevant aspects of the standard
3. Include challenging edge cases (like interface methods that keep original naming)
4. Add brief comments explaining key standard applications
5. Make examples detailed enough to be useful (30-100 lines each)

Format each example with proper markdown code blocks and include a brief explanation of which aspects of the standards it demonstrates.
